### Introduction
The fundamental idea of my football is based on the desire to play a <ins>proactive football, a possession-based and attacking football</ins>. I would like to play total football and collective, with 11 players being active offensively and defensively. By controlling space and time, we have the ambition to command the play in both phases.

The <ins>"gioco"</ins> must be the identity of my team. The term "gioco" refers to the identity composing principles, positionings, and mentality of the players themselves. A football based on collectivity but still allowing individuals to express their strongest traits.

The two cardinal principles in my idea of football are related to the ball: we want and we must keep it as much as possible until we attack and we must ferociously and aggressively try to win it back immediately if we lose the ball.

In modern football nowadays, formation is changing its function. Instead of static positionings of players, we are now <ins>occupying spaces dynamically based on the principles devised in the game plan</ins>. The arrangement varies in two phases (offensive and defensive) and the emotional moment that is ever changing during the match.

We will therefore look for technical and dynamic players, putting emphasis on one-on-one situations, especially for wide players.

Through exercises, we want to help players recognize different situations and adapt to the __context__ of the match that are increasingly <ins>liquid</ins>.

The definition and creation the <ins>__ideal CONTEXT__</ins> (tactical, techical, physical, and mental) to allow our players to best express themselves will be our most important challenge.

I would to also mention the teams that have inspired the formation of my idea of football. Teams and coaches that I have admired as a fan and those I have the fortune to play against: Cruijff's and Guardiola's Barcelona, Van Gaal's Ajax, Ancelotti's Milan, and finally, Conte's Juventus.
